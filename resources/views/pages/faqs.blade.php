This would, however, depend if any of our registered members providing dispute resolution services would like to take your case on a partnership – ownership-oriented basis. You can select “Award Percentage Based Only” in the Dispute Resolution Service Requirement Form. You can put your desired percentage out of the award which you may want to share with your chosen dispute resolution partner(s).</p>

                                <p class="faq-content mt-3">Ownership-Oriented Model is dependent upon an Ownership-Oriented Mindset. It is to see claim disputes with the eye of the investment methodology and analysis as practiced, polished and promoted by Benjamin Graham and Warren E. Buffett in the Investment Industry. It is a time-proven (over 80 years now with around a 4 million percentage return) and classic Investment Methodology primarily based upon long-term and fundamental perspectives. We believe that if this Investment Methodology is put at the heart of legal finance, it will make the legal finance industry better than ever. If you want to read more about the Ownership-Oriented Model please just click on the beforementioned highlighted link.
                                    Where the Award-Percentage Sharing basis may or may not follow the Ownership-Oriented Model (Mindset) but Ownership-Oriented Model (Mindset) makes assure that the Award-Percentage Sharing basis succeeds on a long-term basis for the legal finance industry to succeed and thrive. The Ownership-Oriented Model has the characteristics to expand and elevate the practiced justice to a greater equitable justice for all parties involved. Ownership Orientation can very well be practiced even on the Fee and Award-Percentage sharing basis. However, it would be hard to practice this on only the fee-based model of dispute resolution services but may still very well be practiced when the idea is to generate ideas and knowledge that contribute greatly to elevating the zenith of justice. Here the ownership will be non-monetary and will be to elevate the intrinsic nature of the justice system.</p>

                                <p class="faq-content mt-3">Yes, the Fermi questions can be used to work out rough estimates and yes these questions can be applied upon quantum evaluation, legal scope and investment analysis to get to an approximate answer of questions on a short span of time.  Ownership Orientation itself is based upon approximation – we are looking for a place where physics and business joins in the perspective of legal framework. </p>

                                    A "Fermi question" is a question in physics which seeks a fast, rough estimate of quantity which is either difficult or impossible to measure directly. Fermi Questions are named after Enrico Fermi, a Nobel Laureate in Physics, who was famous for doing order-of-magnitude calculations in his head.

                                    A Fermi problem is an approximate, back-of-the-envelope calculation of an arbitrary figure facilitated by identifying suitable factors of the figure, that are accessible to common experience. Depending on the difficulty of the problem, and the number of sub-problems required to get in touch with common sense, one can usually hope to be correct to within a factor of 2 or 3, and other times to within the correct order of magnitude.A "Fermi question" is a question in physics which seeks a fast, rough estimate of quantity which is either difficult or impossible to measure directly.
